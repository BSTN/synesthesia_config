# Number - Colour Test

This is a test for number-colour synaesthesia. In this 
form of synaesthesia, you associate colours to numbers, 
even if you can see them being printed in another colour.

Choose the colour that you associate with the number, 
or the colour that you find most fitting. Try to choose
as intuitively as possible â€“ there is no right or wrong answer.

This test will take about 5 minutes to complete.
